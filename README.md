## What would i do better if i had more time with this project ?
- Improve the quality of the unit tests, as they are very basic at the moment
- Improve the work flow regarding localization, because at the moment if a new text is added the programmer needs to manually add translations to each translation files
- Improve the UI in general by making it more modern and make it more flexible by adding themes
